##Problem Description

Ability for users of your application to complete a video interview;
solution requires the ability for participants to view and hear
each other, a requirement for the interview to be recorded is also desirable.

How would you approach based on the following assumptions, technologies?


####Assumptions

1. An interviewer and interviewee are attending the interview i.e. two people.
2. You must use all web technologies, solution must be native to a web browser.
3. Solution needs to work browser vendor X to browser vendor Y.

####Technologies

Solution must run via web browser, no need to be concerned with IOS or
MAC OS for version one i.e. don’t be concerned with running the solution on
Apple based devices.

You will need to be conscious of where recorded video will be stored.

Backend database is Oracle, but this should not really make a difference.

Concentrate mainly on the front end, as mentioned users will be using
Web browsers to interact with your solution.


####Bonus - Mobile Devices
Would you have thoughts how your solution might work on mobile devices.
